Downloading tools

There are many downloading tools like snarf, pavuk, fget, fetch, lftp, aria2, HTTrack,wget and curl.

Despite all these tools we mostly use curl and wget. Because they offer more services than other.

WGET

wget is more popular than curl. It is easy to use. Does not need any options like -o -O to be given.
NO library.
Non-Interactive command line. It is easily used in automating jobs like shells and crontabs.
It also works in Windows.

// this is the best part of the wget.


CURL

curl supports big bunch of protocols unlike wget.
It has library and offers Many functions with options. 

sachin@sachins~$ curl https://github.com

//it downloaded me all the source code in the terminal
I copied the the source and pasted it in a empty html page.
When I opened the saved html page, it redirected me to same index page.
It is same as the page downloaded by the wget.

sachin@sachins:~/practice$ ls
explore  indexcurl.html  indexcurl.html~  index.html

sachin@sachins:~/practice$ curl http://jayapachallu.com https://github.com

// multiple URLs in single command line 
// multiple http protocols like http and https at at time 

sachin@sachins:~/practice$ curl -u venesh31:123456 https://github.com

//curl is also used to login, but now a days this not accepted by websites.



ADDing and ReMoving Users

sachin@sachins:~$ sudo useradd -m /bin/bash ganguly

//sudo useradd userdel and usermod are the old version commands. While, Using useradd we need to add parameter "-m" to create the home folder.

sachin@sachins:/home$ ls
ganguly  sachin
sachin@sachins:/home$ ls
ganguly  sachin

// As -m  is used with useradd, ganguly folder is created in the home. 
 
sachin@sachins:~$ sudo adduser sehwag
Adding user `sehwag' ...
Adding new group `sehwag' (1001) ...
Adding new user `sehwag' (1001) with group `sehwag' ...
Creating home directory `/home/sehwag' ...
Copying files from `/etc/skel' ...
Enter new UNIX password: 
Retype new UNIX password: 

sachin@sachins:~$ cd /
sachin@sachins:/$ cd home
sachin@sachins:/home$ ls
ganguly  sachin  sehwag

/*sudo adduser sehwag
so using adduser, I did not give any parameters to create a home folder. Although it created the home folder in home named after sehwag.
*/

Deleting a user 

sachin@sachins:~$ sudo deluser ganguly
[sudo] password for sachin: 
Removing user `ganguly' ...
Warning: group `ganguly' has no more members.
Done.

 
CHOWN

I have a file called "Assignmenet" in the home folder of sachin.
Being user, sachin I want to change the owner of the owner of the Assignment.

sachin@sachins:~$ ls -l
total 61840
-rw-rw-r-- 1 sachin sachin      907 Jan 23 23:39 Assignment

sachin is still the owner of the file Assignment, now I have to change the owner to sehwag. I have to use CHOWN.

sachin@sachins:~$ sudo chown sehwag Assignment
sachin@sachins:~$ ls -l
total 61840
-rw-rw-r-- 1 sehwag sachin      907 Jan 23 23:39 Assignment

You can see the owner has been changed to sehwag from the sachin.
So, now sehwag is the owner of the Assignment


CHMOD

sachin@saechins:~$ ls -l
drwxr-xr-x 2 sachin sachin     4096 Jan 21 03:11 Documents

/* sachin being the owner of the folder "Documents", other users in the group and others can still read and execute the files in the folder. So, As the documents is the important folder I want it to be only rwx by me. */

sachin@sachins:~$ sudo chmod  700 Documents

drwx------ 2 sachin sachin     4096 Jan 21 03:11 Documents

// All the permissions of groups and others are denied using chmod.

sudo chmod 777 Documents

drwxrwxrwx 2 sachin sachin     4096 Jan 21 03:11 Documents
// Gives all  permissions to User,Group, Others with 777.

r = 4
w = 2
x = 1
r+w+x = 7.

After changing the permissions color of the folder changes into green.


Blue: Directory
Green: Executable or recognized data file
Sky Blue: Linked file
Yellow with black background: Device
Pink: Graphic image file
Red: Archive file


sachin@sachins:~$ sudo chmod 111 Documents
sachin@sachins:~$ ls -l
d--x--x--x 2 sachin sachin     4096 Jan 21 03:11 Documents
// 111 gives the UGO to only execute the files.


sachin@sachins:~$ sudo chmod 722 Documents
sachin@sachins:~$ ls -l
drwx-w--w- 2 sachin sachin     4096 Jan 21 03:11 Documents
// 722 gives the rwx for U, only for both G and O.


CHGRP

sachin@sachins:~$ groups
sachin adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare
//sachin current groups are listed above.


sachin@sachins:~$ groups sehwag
sehwag : sehwag
////Sehwag belongs to only his group.

sachin@sachins:~$ groups sachin
sachin : sachin adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare
//sachin belongs to all the groups listed above.

sachin@sachins~$ sudo su 
root@sachins:/# groupadd cricket
//created a new group called cricket

Adding sachin to this newly created group cricket

sachin@sachins~$ usermod -aG cricket sachin
where,
-G, --groups GROUPS new list of supplementary GROUPS
-a, --append append the user to the supplemental GROUPS

sachin@sachins:/$ groups sachin
sachin : sachin adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare cricket

//Now sachin added in to the group cricket


//Although we create a group, it will not show until we add atleast a user to it.

sachin@sachins:/$ sudo usermod -G cricket sachin

// this command is used to assign the user to group given and removing from all other groups(secondary groups).

sachin@sachins:/$ groups sachin
sachin : sachin cricket

// Earlier User sachin was in all the groups like dev,cdrom etc now he is  in his own group sachin and given group cricket

sachin@sachins:/$ gpasswd --help
Usage: gpasswd [option] GROUP

Options:
  -a, --add USER                add USER to GROUP
  -d, --delete USER             remove USER from GROUP

Removing User from group

sachin@sachins:/$ groups sachin
sachin : sachin cricket opener
//sachin is in 3 groups

sachin@sachins:/$ sudo gpasswd -d sachin cricket
Removing user sachin from group cricket
//removed sachin from cricket

sachin@sachins:/$ groups sachin
sachin : sachin opener
//sachin is still in the other secondary group opener

RENAME is not same as MV

MV is used to change the name of the single file

sachin@sachins:~$ ls
Assignment        Pictures
//lets rename the Assignment to Assignment_1

sachin@sachins:~$ mv Assignment Assignment_1
sachin@sachins:~$ ls
Assignment_1       Pictures

// it is renamed



RENAME
Rename is used to change the multiple file names at a time.
It uses perl expressions. 


sachin@sachins:~$ mkdir rename
sachin@sachins:~$ cd rename
// now I created a folder rename

sachin@sachins:~/rename$ touch venkatesh phani karthik venesh
// creating four files with lower case alphabets(a-z).

sachin@sachins:~/rename$ ls
karthik  phani  venesh  venkatesh
// files created

command to rename the file names from lower case to upper case.

sachin@sachins:~/rename$ rename 'y/a-z/A-Z/' *
// above command is to change the file names from lower to upper

sachin@sachins:~/rename$ ls
KARTHIK  PHANI  VENESH  VENKATESH
//yes, they are created

command to remove the spaces in between.
rename 's/_//' *

sachin@sachins:~/rename$ touch karthik_chinnaganta venesh_bathula
// creating the files with spaces i.e underscores in between

sachin@sachins:~/rename$ ls
KARTHIK  karthik_chinnaganta  PHANI  VENESH  venesh_bathula  VENKATESH
//files created

renaming spaces by removing spaces

sachin@sachins:~/rename$ rename 's/_//' *

sachin@sachins:~/rename$ ls
KARTHIK  karthikchinnaganta  PHANI  VENESH  veneshbathula  VENKATESH
//spaces are removed creating new file names.
